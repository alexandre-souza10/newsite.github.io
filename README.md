## Project Description:
- In this Project, a website page was developed, a Front-End project, using HTML, CSS, Java Script, and the Bootstrap Framework.
On the page we found a more advanced design, using Bootstrap tools. We also found at the top of the page a sign up
on Our Site, where we insert the E-mail in the indicated field, we have a Welcome message, and one about the company, information about the company's differentials
a History, and a contact the team to learn more about the company and its services.

- The Project has the functionality of showing a page of a finance company, and its entire process, with a whole team to assist in the process,
in a Front-End environment.

- Below is a short instructional video where we show an example of how the New Website page works.
